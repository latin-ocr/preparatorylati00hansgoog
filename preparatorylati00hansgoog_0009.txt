throwing light upon the classic page, to afford both teacher end
pupil that kind of help which they meet need.

'lhe introductiou of synonyme, to any considerable extent,
into a work so elementary as this, is a feature almost, if not
wholly new; aud itis hoped that it may not prove unaceeptable
to those of my follow-taechers especially, who are engaged in
preparing young men for college. 'ihs practice of discrimi-

object without the necessity of incurring the expense os a lexicon.
